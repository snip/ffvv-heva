# Java example

This is a Java example to interact with FFVV's Heva application.
It is based on code provided by AAPCA-Fayence.

WsseToken.java is the code allowing authentication in WSSE format following description of http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/12/17/dive.html

You can reuse this file in your Java application.

GetLicences.java is just a basic application demonstrating how to use it. Edit this file and replace login and password by your own WSSE login and password provided by the FFVV.
