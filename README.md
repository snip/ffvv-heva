Examples to interact with FFVV Heva application

I will try to put here a collection of examples in different languages to interact with FFVV's Heva web application.

API documentation can be found here: http://docs.ffvv.apiary.io/

You can test your application with it but there is no authentication required.

Base url for **production** is http://api.licences.ffvv.stadline.com/
