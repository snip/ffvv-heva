# PHP example

This is a PHP exemple to interact with FFVV's Heva application.

wssetoken.php is the code allowing authentication in WSSE format following decription of http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/12/17/dive.html

You can reuse this file in your PHP application.

get-licences.sh is just a shell application demonstrating how to use it with Curl. Edit this file and replace login and password by your own WSSE login and password provided by the FFVV.
